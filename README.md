# Machine Learning for Earth Sciences (AY: 2022)

This course is intended to provide a hands-on introduction to Machine Learning with a focus on its applications for researchers in Earth Sciences.

## Prerequisites: 
The following are assumed for each participant,
* Undergraduate level math proficiency.
* Acquainted with scientific research methodology.
* Intermediate level Python proficiency
* No background in ML.
* Basic knowledge of various domains within Earth Sciences.

## Note:
* Python will be used as the programming language for instruction.
* The course proceedings will be hands-on and will require you to either use local python installation or Google Colab.
* Lecture content will not delve into the mathematical derivations of ML algorithms, but will cover the intuition and the necessary math to properly utilize the algorithms.
* This course will not have an assigned book as a primary reading reference, but will instead list out books, blogs, YouTube videos, GitHub repositories and such to serve as references that students are encouraged to explore.
* All necessary materials will be provided in the form of hand-outs, code exercises, recordings and such.
